## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.3.0
* win-builder (devel and release)
* local Ubuntu 14.04 , R 3.3.0
* local Windows 10, R 3.3.0

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORS and no WARNINGS

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of couchDB 
(https://github.com/FvD/RcouchDB/blob/master/revdep/). There seem to be no
reverse dependencies at this time.
