### Abstract
The couchDB package has been designed for communication with couchDB, a popular
noSQL database. For details consult the help pages for

 * couch_http_connection
 * couch_create_database
 * couch_fetch
 * couch_store
 
### 1 Get connected
To interact with a couchDB instance you will need to create a connection
object. Communication with couchDB happens over a http protocol. A minimal
connection (running on the default port and no password protection) would be:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(couchDB)
myConn  <- couch_http_connection("localhost")
```
 
The variable "myConn" can now be used as parameters to other functions. 
 
For convenience a default connection can also be created with
`couch_set_default_connection` using the same parameters.

Once a connection object exists, you may want to make sure it is connecting
correctly with the `couch_ping` function. If you are properly connected the
reponse should look like:

```
  Response [http://localhost:5984]
  Status: 200
  Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
  Size: 151 B
  {"couchdb":"Welcome","uuid":"c1a367c91517195b57ddafe788a72b75","version":"1.4.0","vendor"
  {"name":"...
```

To connect to cloudant specify the service (otherwise it defaults to couchdb) as follows:

```{r}
myConn <- couch_http_connection(host = "demo.cloudant.com",
                                    https = TRUE,
                                    service = "cloudant")
```

```
Response [https://demo.cloudant.com/]
  Date: 2016-05-13 16:50
  Status: 200
  Content-Type: application/json
  Size: 64 B
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"1.0.2","cloudant_build":"2580"}
```

### 2. Working with couchDB databases
On a couchDB install there can be several databases (i.e. namespaces). The
function

 * couch_list_databases 
 
will provide a list of available databases on the connection provided.

The function `couch_create_database` will, similarly, allow you to create a
new database or namespace on the couchDB instance.

### 3. Setting defaults
CouchDB allows for setting a default connection and a default database to work
with. This is useful, and provides for cleaner code, if you are mainly working
with one specific database at a specific connection.  

### 4. Working with documents
Once you have a connection and a database to work with you can fetch, store and
delete documents by using the corresponding functions:
 
 * couch_fetch
 * couch_fetch_default
 * couch_store
 * couch_store_default 
 * couch_delete
 
The document to be stored can be provided either as a list (which will be
converted to json for insertion), or for tighter control over the document
structure a character vector in json format can be provided.
